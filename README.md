# Intelligent-Picking

## Description
This project aims to automate the process of picking and placing objects in the manufacturing and warehouse industry. By leveraging advanced technologies such as a camera, an articulated arm, and optimized algorithms, the system enables accurate and efficient handling of heavy payloads. The intelligent picking system utilizes an onboard camera to detect and identify objects, allowing for precise targeting and positioning.

## Features
* **Camera-based Object Detection**: The system incorporates an onboard camera that captures images of the objects to be picked. Through advanced computer vision techniques, the system can detect and identify the objects with high accuracy.

* **Optimized Articulated Arm Design**: The project includes an articulated arm specifically designed to handle heavy payloads. The arm's design optimizes its strength, stability, and range of motion, ensuring reliable and efficient object manipulation.

* **Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance**: To navigate the articulated arm to the desired location, the system utilizes sophisticated path-planning algorithms. These algorithms consider obstacles in the environment and calculate the optimal trajectory to reach the target, ensuring smooth and obstacle-free movement.

* **Kinematics for Arm Movement**: The project incorporates kinematics principles to control the arm's movements. By calculating joint angles and positions, the system achieves precise control over the arm's motion, enabling accurate picking and placing of objects.

* **PID Control for Stability**: The system employs a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm to ensure stability and precise control during the picking and placing process. This control mechanism adjusts the arm's movements based on real-time feedback, minimizing errors and enhancing performance.
